# Estimating Defense Contract Overages and Termination Risks with Supervised Learning

## Overview/Synopsis
With an annual budget in excess of $500 Billion, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is one of the single largest money-spenders in the world. Each year, they award billions of dollars in contracts to research, develop, build, procure, or otherwise produce materials and technology to promote the public defense. These contracts can take vastly different forms and terms, encompassing everything from next-generation weapon systems to replenishing office supplies.

Given the sheer scope and variety of these contacts, it can be difficult for those making procurement decisions to reliably know what new contracts are the best deals, and which have the highest risk. Using a record of completed DoD contracts from the past 16 years, we use a Random Forest model to see what combination of contract features (e.g. duration, cost, competitive bids) are the most powerful predictors for whether a given new contract will a) exceed its original budget (i.e. a raised cost ceiling), and/or b) be terminated before completion.


## Use
TODO: Specific example of what happens in your project (e.g. what's going on under the hood)

## Data Used
TODO: Where you got your data, description about the data

## Installation
TODO: Describe the installation process 
Note: only for cases where you're developing a new package or software.

## Usage
TODO: Write usage instructions 
Note: If you're providing a new package or software, provide examples of how to use your code (example: https://github.com/CommerceDataService/eu.us.opendata). If you're providing an analytical output, describe what goes on each file or how to run it.
